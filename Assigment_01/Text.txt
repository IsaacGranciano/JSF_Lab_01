What is Node.JS?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows
developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on 
Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers Google Chrome.

JavaScript Everywhere: Node.js enables the use of JavaScript for both front-end
(client-side) and back-end (server-side) development, promoting a unified language
approach for web applications.
